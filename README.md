# Extraction and Handling of Data with Python from MySQL Workbench for SQL Server

This integration was created in order to improve the efficiency and speed of a data extraction through a SELECT in the MySQL Workbench of a company and insertion of this SELECT handled inside the SQL Server of another company.

I used the bulk insert inside the procedure in SQL Server to be able to improve the insertion time of the data inside the database.

Note: Bulk insert requires the CSV to be inside the final database server.
